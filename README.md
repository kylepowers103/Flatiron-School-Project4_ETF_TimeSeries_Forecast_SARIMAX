#### Our Objective

The objective of our project is neither to build
a system that makes billions nor to waste billions
But the objective is to develop a system that finds
the direction of change of ETF/STOCK prices based
on the co-relations between STOCK prices and help
the investors in the stock market in taking
a decision whether to buy/sell/hold a ETF or stock by
providing the results in-terms of visualizations
